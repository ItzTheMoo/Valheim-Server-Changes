~~~ [Important Information] ~~~

With the previous map / modpack / server? a couple things have to change
Below are the Big Changes.

You May have to Port Forward 2456-2458 TCP / UDP ports.
- Windows Adv Firewall incoming and outgoing
- and on your local Router

We are No longer using Valheims Middle Man server (Playfab) and or -Crossplay.
- PC players only with us
- Better Networking because of this (Should result in less disconnects, and issues)
- Mod's better use Non-playfab rule.


~~~ [RULES / Do Not Do's] ~~~

No Building Around Trader
- Specifically surrounding the trader so nobody can have access to it.
- This caused lag when teleporting into trader area / even walking into it.

~~~ [Plans Moving Forward and or The Goal] ~~~

Get the server Public.
- gets people in the server, playing, more then just our "friend group"
- Advertising the server.

PVP Included
- Only within Wards is it forced (aka RAIDS!)

Make Drops dissipear after X time
- With the shear about of mobs in plains that fight eachother, drops are abbundant.
  If we add a rule in place to remove drop after 5m this will reduce enity spawns, and lag.

Expand World is still doing the whole "Must Not be installed"
- Its annoying at best, so its still added to the server
- i am looking for a fix, will come later.
- Its pretty so keeping it :)
