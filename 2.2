**NEW MOD** ~ Timed item Destruction
- Items Now Auto Destroy after 1800 seconds (30 minutes) to reduce entity lag on the ground this goes for items inside wards too.
- Keep in mind we have auto Storage ~ Items dropped from for example a smelter will deposit into a nearby box, aslong as said item is also inside that box.
  * This aslo applies to items you just drop too they will auto sort into a chest aslong as said item is already in a box. (goes for using . (Period) just inventory)
